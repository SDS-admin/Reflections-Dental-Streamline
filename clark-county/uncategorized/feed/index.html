A great fitting denture will have a few unique features that let you know everything is going, as it ought to.</p><p><strong>You Don’t Need Adhesive</strong><br
/> A properly fitting denture will stay in place without any type of adhesive, paste, or strips. In fact, dentures should be secured by suction alone &#8211; a tight seal between the denture and your soft tissues across the jaws and roof of the mouth. Adhesives should only be used temporarily to get you by, if something isn’t working out quite right.</p><p><strong>It Doesn’t Slip When You Talk or Chew</strong><br
/> Your denture should fit snuggly when you’re speaking or eating a meal. If it constantly has to be adjusted or slips out of place, it means the denture no longer fits. This could be due to changes in your bone anatomy over time, weight loss, or a worn out denture.</p><p><strong>There Are No Sore Spots</strong><br
/> Do you get sore spots or raw areas under your dentures? Then something isn’t quite right. Your denture may need to be relined, adjusted, or may be completely worn out. Ignoring these sore spots could lead to chronic infections later on.</p><p>Are your dentures loose, worn or broken? Our Dentist in Las Vegas can help! We’re currently offering a discount special on all denture services here in our office. Call us if your denture needs repaired or replaced and we will get you smiling again in no time.</p><p>The post <a

Taking the right steps can save your smile and eliminate discomfort as quickly as possible.</p><p><strong>Save Your Broken Tooth</strong><br
/> If your tooth is broken, try to locate the missing piece of tooth structure when at all possible. Place it into a cup filled with milk or saline (like contact solution) and bring it with you. If you can get access to emergency dental care within an hour, there’s a chance that the broken piece or avulsed tooth can be put back into place. Be sure not to try to clean the tooth section off yourself, as this can damage small fibers that aid in reattachment. We’ll do the cleaning for you!</p><p><strong>Take an Anti-Inflammatory Medication</strong><br
/> Anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen can reduce swelling and thereby the discomfort that some emergencies may cause. Although these may provide momentary pain relief, your body is still trying to tell you that something is wrong &#8211; so call us as quickly as possible.</p><p><strong>Apply a Cold or Warm Compress</strong><br
/> Alternating cold and warm compresses can help you alleviate swelling and discomfort caused by infection. It is a great way to improve momentary discomfort, but professional care should still be sought immediately.</p><p><strong>Call Our Las Vegas Dental Office</strong><br
/> We’ll get you in as quickly as possible, helping you alleviate your pain and giving you as many options available when it comes to repairing your smile. Whether it’s an abscessed tooth or a dental filling, we have several different Special Offers that meet your budget and your aesthetic needs. Call us today.</p><p>The post <a

Keeping your oral bacterial levels in check is extremely important, especially when it comes to conditions like:</p><p>•	Heart disease, stroke, and heart attack<br
/> •	Obesity<br
/> •	Diabetes<br
/> •	Premature labor / low birth weight infants<br
/> •	Erectile dysfunction</p><p>How do all of these conditions relate back to your oral health? Well, active periodontal (gum) disease allows bacteria to enter into the bloodstream through infected gum tissues. This creates an inflammatory response throughout the rest of the body, and also leads to bacterial deposits within the circulatory system. In fact, some cases have been found where oral bacteria were located in the vascular walls of stroke and heart attack victims.</p><p>When your body is fighting off one infection, it makes it difficult to fight off another one. Treating gum disease and reversing the oral infection in turn improves your overall health. It becomes easier to manage blood sugar levels, fight off infections, and have a stronger immune system.</p><p>Do you have gum disease? Symptoms include receding gums, gums that bleed or are swollen, tooth mobility and bad breath. Waiting until it’s too late to treat will lead to complete tooth loss.</p><p>Our Las Vegas dental office can help you eliminate your periodontal infection with our in-house periodontal therapy program. These treatments consist of deep cleanings that eliminate tartar and bacterial deposits along the root surfaces, making it easier for you to maintain your oral hygiene at home. Our hygienists will also work with you to create a home hygiene plan that reverses the infection much quicker.</p><p>Check out our special offers on Periodontal Scaling services at our Las Vegas dentist office.</p><p>The post <a

Our Las Vegas teeth whitening treatments can whiten your teeth by several shades, helping you remove year’s worth of stains or natural tooth discoloration. For the best results possible, follow these easy steps:</p><p><strong>Avoid Dark Liquids and Tobacco</strong><br
/> If you smoke, use smokeless tobacco, or drink dark liquids like coffee, tea or red wine &#8211; then your stain will be harder to eliminate. If you absolutely must have that glass of iced tea for an afternoon pick me up, then drink it through a straw to prevent it from coming into contact with your teeth.</p><p><strong>Get Your Teeth Cleaned Regularly</strong><br
/> Professional dental cleanings will remove superficial stains and tartar buildup that accumulates over time. We recommend that most people have a cleaning every 6 months to keep their mouths healthy and free of gum disease.</p><p><strong>Touch Up Frequently</strong><br
/> Touch up your whitening treatments for a few days at a time, every 3-4 months. This way, there are fewer and lighter stains that need to be removed over the course of time. Your teeth will stay whiter, longer, because there is less stain accumulation. Touching up after dental cleanings is more effective because the gel has direct contact with your clean enamel.</p><p><strong>Refrigerate Your Gel</strong><br
/> If you’re between whitening and touch-ups, store your whitening gel in the refrigerator. It helps the solution stay active longer, preventing you from needing to purchase refill gels as often.</p><p>Are you a candidate for teeth whitening? Schedule a consultation to find out.

Our implant-retained dentures offer freedom and flexibility that traditional dentures can’t. Here are just a few reasons why you should consider them for your smile:</p><p><strong>They’re Slimmer</strong><br
/> Unlike conventional dentures, All-on-4 dentures follow the “U” shape of your jaws. There is no bulky acrylic across the roof of your mouth that makes it difficult to talk. This frees up space in the rest of your mouth, making it easier for you to speak more clearly and enjoy the taste of each meal.</p><p><strong>They’re Permanent</strong><br
/> You won’t have to worry about a denture that moves around or comes out of place when you talk or enjoy a meal. All-on-4 dentures are permanently anchored into your mouth at all times. You’ll never have to worry about adhesives or pastes to keep your denture in place. Since it’s so slim, there is no need for it to come in and out.</p><p><strong>You Only Need 4 Implants</strong><br
/> A full mount implant-supported denture needs as few as 4 implants to hold it in place. How is that? Because implants are stronger than natural teeth! Once implants are placed into the jaws they actually encourage new bone growth to occur. This makes your denture more secure and also improves the health of your mouth.</p><p>Our Las Vegas All-on-4 Dentures can give you the permanent new smile and self-confidence that you deserve. Check out our specials on Dental Implants and Dentures to enjoy a new smile at an affordable price! If you’ve been told that implants aren’t an option or you want a second opinion, call our Las Vegas implant dentist today.</p><p>The post <a

The way they are designed. Like other veneers, Lumineers are bonded over the front of natural teeth to change their appearance. However, the materials offer a slight translucency to them, which enhances the natural hues of the final treatment. As a result, teeth look:</p><ul><li>Whiter</li><li>Straighter</li><li>Naturally colored</li><li>More even</li></ul><p><strong>Easier Veneer Treatments</strong><br
/> Traditional veneer treatments are a complex procedure, because complex results are necessary. Lumineers offer a straighter approach to veneer treatments. Because they are thinner, there is no tooth preparation necessary prior to the veneer placement. They are sometimes called “no prep veneers,” because the natural tooth structure does not require alteration during the treatment process. Each Lumineers veneer is simply bonded to clean, conditioned tooth enamel. In fact, if you ever decide to have your Lumineers removed, they are completely reversible without any other necessary treatment. Enjoy the benefits of traditional veneers without the slight alteration to your underlying tooth enamel.</p><p>Las Vegas based Streamline Dental is currently offering 25% off all of our Lumineers smile makeovers. With this affordable opportunity, our patients can benefit from a straightforward smile enhancement that gives you quick, dramatic results. Are you ready to find out more?

Our professional strength gel contains natural ingredients that cause stain particles to lift off of the enamel. Since our teeth are extremely porous, years of stain particles can build up just under the surface of your enamel, inside of these pores. Using a professional whitening method is safer and more effective at stain removal than weaker, one-size-fits-some over the counter kits. Simply wear your customized tray for an hour each day, for up to two weeks. You’ll see results within just a few treatments.</p><p>If you&#8217;re self-conscious about the way your smile looks or are want to make that best first impression &#8211; call Streamline Dental. In just a few easy steps we can help you whiten your teeth by as many as 8 shades! Our current special includes 30% off teeth whitening services at our Las Vegas office.

Otherwise these other medical issues may never resolve, due to the increased level of bacteria in general.</p><p>Streamline Dentists recommend a periodontal scaling and root planing, otherwise known as a “deep cleaning” to help manage and reverse your periodontal infection. Deep cleanings remove loose and calcified bacterial deposits around the roots of the teeth, providing you with a clean environment that promotes tissue reattachment.

First, our Streamline Dentists discuss what aspect of your tooth you want to change. You&#8217;ll be able to change the tooth size and shape as necessary. We will then carefully color-match the bonding material to your natural enamel, so that it blends in with the tooth once the cosmetic procedure is completed. Your dentist then cleans and preps the tooth, applies the bonding, shapes it appropriately and uses a bright light to harden it into place. In just one short visit it looks as if you have a completely brand new tooth. The process is simple and may not even require the use of local anesthesia.</p><p>Bonding can be used for cosmetic purposes but it also provides a protective aspect as well. Underlying root or broken tooth surfaces are more susceptible to sensitivity and tooth decay. Covering these areas with bonding will prevent stimuli or bacteria from reaching these weaker layers of the tooth.</p><p><strong>Las Vegas Dental Bonding</strong><br
