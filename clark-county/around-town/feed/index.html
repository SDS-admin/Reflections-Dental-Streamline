class="p1">If you are moving to Las Vegas, there is more to the move than just finding a new home and job. Moving into an area known for tourists and entertainment you need to locate the right support system such as doctors, dentists, CPA’s, child care, shopping and whatever else you may need to make you life more comfortable.<span
class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you have <a
href="http://moving.about.com/od/youremovingnowwhat/tp/coping_with_a_move.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dealt with a major move</a> before, you know that it means finding these new resources can help you settle in and feel more at home much faster than waiting for a situation where you find yourself scrambling to find a solution. Here are just a few things you need to know as you move to Las Vegas.</p><h3 class="p1"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3702" src="../../../../dentistoflasvegasnv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Paris-las-vegas-300x300.jpg" alt="paris fountain las vegas" width="300" height="300" /> Entertainment and Food Off the Strip</h3><p
class="p1">Entertainment and social opportunities are not limited to the Strip. You can explore a variety of museums and historical places, including the Mob Museum, Pinball Hall of Fame, and the Neon Museum. Yet, this is just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. Additionally, there are plenty of food options off the Strip that brings a unique flavor to the residents outside the realm of the tourists. If you enjoy the outdoors, there are plenty of places available for hiking and biking although it can get pretty warm out.</p><h3 class="p1">Follow the Housing Market</h3><p
class="p1">Housing is cheap in the city and even in the outlying suburbs. While many urban areas have seen increases in the cost of housing, thanks to the housing bust that was part of the recession, housing in Las Vegas remains surprisingly affordable. However, the tradeoff is that you need to have a car, because public transportation is not very effective. Still, you can balance that cost out with the lack of state income tax, which is unusual compared to most states.</p><h3 class="p1">Hospitality Work</h3><p
class="p1">This is a hospitality mecca, so there are plenty of employment options for those who enjoy working with people on vacation or business trips. But along with all those hospitality employees, there need to be the support services that these employees need, including physicians and dentists. So how can you find a quality physician or dentist in a new city, such as Las Vegas?</p><h3 class="p1"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3700" src="../../../../dentistoflasvegasnv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Las-Vegas-Things-to-do--300x300.jpg" alt="las vegas skyline " width="300" height="300" />Dentists and Doctors</h3><p
class="p1">If you are looking for a general doctor or dentist, the yellow pages and Google can provide you a variety of options with reviews from individuals who have visited these professionals. Depending on the dentist or doctor, you may even be able to book your appointment online. However, if you need any specific cosmetic work done, then you will need to search specifically for<strong> cosmetic dentists, which are available in most parts of Clark County including Las Vegas</strong>.</p><p
class="p1">Because of the number of shows and entertainment choices available in Vegas, there are plenty of high end <a
href="http://dentistoflasvegasnv.com/">cosmetic dentistry offices</a> who cater to both the stars and more traditional residents. These dentists can provide veneers, bonding, crowns and caps that address a variety of dental issues. Don&#8217;t forget you have plenty of options available so shop around for new patient specials and promotions .</p><p
class="p1">As you can see, Las Vegas offers plenty of opportunities for both work and entertainment, but there are also plenty of businesses and medical care outside the city proper. If you need to move to Sin City, rest assured you will find everything you need, from a family and community atmosphere, to high rise condos and more.</p><p>The post <a

href="http://usatravel.about.com/od/Top-Destinations/ss/Top-10-USA-Destinations.htm" target="_blank" rel="">most popular destinations in the United States</a>. Known for its fun and unique vibe, millions of people clamor to the inspiring city every year. However, while most may have a strong inkling as to what Las Vegas is like, there is also a hidden side that many do not know about. Here are seven interesting things about Las Vegas that you may not have known:</p><h3>Vegas is Not Family Oriented</h3><p>Behind all the glitz, glamor, and show business, Vegas is highly family oriented. The suburban neighborhoods have excellent school districts, there are many organizations, and community centers to join, and many note the city as relatively comfortable place to life.</p><h3>Clark County Has Bad Medical Care</h3><p>Aside from being family oriented, Vegas is also known for its astounding medical care. From general medical clinics to cosmetic dentistry, there are numerous high-quality offices that residents take advantage of to meet their needs. A select few of cosmetic dentists are also well-renowned for their work, making Vegas great place for those who want quality cosmetic and medical care.</p><h3><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3702" src="../../../../dentistoflasvegasnv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Paris-las-vegas-300x300.jpg" alt="paris fountain las vegas " width="300" height="300" />It&#8217;s All About Casinos</h3><p>Completely not true. Vegas is a prominent destination for shopping, restaurants, business, and even conventions. There are also many national parks and tourist attractions in Vegas that you certainly should take advantage of.</p><h3>Vegas is All Corporate</h3><p>Another misconception about Vegas is that it is controlled by corporate, thereby preventing small businesses from flourishing. If you want to establish a business in Vegas, then you can feel confident in doing so. There are many mom and pop shops, restaurants, and the like in the beautiful desert city.</p><h3>It is Outrageously Expensive to Live in Vegas</h3><p>Also, untrue; average home prices in Las Vegas are around $200,000. Compared to other major cities in the United States, Vegas is very affordable. However, while Vegas is affordable for residents, it can be extremely expensive for tourists.</p><h3>Vegas Is Not Classy</h3><p>Finally, the worst misconception is that Vegas is a tacky place to live. To the contrary, Vegas is located in the beautiful Mojave Desert and residents ultimately appreciate the stunning scenic views, the sunsets, and the year-round warmth. There really are few places that you can choose to live that come close to the splendor that is Vegas.</p><p>Now, that you know the <a
href="http://dentistoflasvegasnv.com/clark-county/around-town/">true Las Vegas</a>, you can make the right decision in terms of your interests, needs, and living location. At the end of the day, it is always wise to have the facts straight.</p><p>The post <a
