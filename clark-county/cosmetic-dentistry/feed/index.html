Unfortunately, like most individuals, you may be lost which type of orthodontic treatment you should use. For many adult patients, the <strong>Invisalign vs braces </strong>debate is something that needs to be resolved.</p><h2>Understanding the Need for Teeth Alignment</h2><p>One of the major issues dentists cites why there is a need to maintain teeth in perfect alignment is in the prevention or management of a bad bite. This can grossly interfere with the proper chewing of food. Additionally, and maybe more importantly, a bad bite has been closely associated with a greater risk for the development of dental caries, tooth decay, and gingivitis. These are all signs of a worsening periodontal disease. Furthermore, because the teeth are not in their normal alignment, muscles of the jaws become strained and the unusual stress and strain exerted on teeth can predispose them to break easily.</p><p>It is for this reason that teeth realignment must be initiated. Currently, Invisalign and dental braces are the two most preferred methods. But, clearly, which one should you choose?</p><h2>The Benefits of Invisalign</h2><p>If you have minor to moderate teeth misalignment, then Invisalign should work for you. These orthodontic devices are made of clear or transparent materials, which should simply come in handy for individuals who don’t want the whole world to know that they are wearing an orthodontic device. The <a
href="http://dentistoflasvegasnv.com/5-myths-about-cosmetic-dentistry/">orthodontist or cosmetic dentist</a> will create a digital impression of your bite and from the computer-generated image an orthodontic appliance will be created. This is Invisalign. Ideally, it should be worn 24 hours a day. Dentists often recommend a change-out twice a month. Invisalign does not interfere with speech and is preferred by younger adults aside from its transparent appearance. They are easier to clean and maintain as well.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you have back tooth bite problems or have issues in your canines and premolars or simply more complex teeth problems, Invisalign is clearly not for you. For many dentists, Invisalign is only good for people who are very conscious about wearing dental braces. Aside from that it does not help correct major teeth alignment problems.</p><h2>Why Dental Braces are Better</h2><p>It is for this reason that dental braces are still preferred by individuals who may have moderate to severe teeth misalignment, bad bites, and diastema. In fact, because dental braces are fixed onto the surface of the teeth, they are more effective in realigning teeth in a significantly shorter time than do <a
href="http://www.invisalign.com/?gclid=Cj0KEQjw09C5BRDy972s6q2y4egBEiQA5_guvxQKWgjoILnYXp2X_URKdJvvCi7HbGc_HYuqHnGFmV0aAlKI8P8HAQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Invisalign</a> aligners. The bracket that sits on each tooth and connected by a stainless wire allows minute movements of the teeth that can help in establishing the correct alignment of the teeth. While food particles do have the tendency to get trapped between the brackets and the tooth surface, meticulous care can help improve the braces’ overall functionality.</p><p>If you getting <a
href="http://dentistoflasvegasnv.com/clark-county/cosmetic-dentistry/">dental work for appearance</a>, get the Invisalign. But for optimum functionality and usefulness, adults will still prefer the dental brace.</p><p>The post <a

While many now consider <strong>cosmetic dentistry</strong> as integral in the maintenance of optimum oral and dental health, there are still others who believe in certain myths about cosmetic dental treatments. Here are five of the common myths.</p><h2>1. Cosmetic Dental Procedures are Expensive</h2><p>Partly true. Cosmetic dental procedures are expensive. Compared to <a
href="https://www.angieslist.com/research/oral-health-and-teeth-cleaning/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">general teeth cleaning and tooth extractions</a>, cosmetic dental procedures can easily run in the hundreds of dollars. But, considering that cosmetic dental procedures do not only work to improve the overall appearance of your teeth but also restores the function of your teeth, the economic implications are simply limitless. Some treatments are designed to protect your teeth from harm so you will save yourself from more expensive dental treatments later. Additionally, with teeth that is looking ever so healthy, it will be a lot easier to land your dream jobs or even to sell something to people simply because of your winning smile. Now imagine if this was translated into economic terms then you will understand that cosmetic dental procedures are relatively inexpensive. Additionally, there are many flexible payment options so you can be home with the best looking teeth at a significantly friendly price.</p><h2>2. Cosmetic Dental Treatments Won’t Make Your Teeth Look Natural</h2><p>On the contrary, today’s advances in dental technologies allow the development and fabrication of cosmetic dental devices that are naturally-looking than ever. People won’t simply know that you had a major upgrade done on your teeth. That is how natural today’s procedures have become.</p><h2>3. Cosmetic Dental Treatments are Painful</h2><p>Pain is what the person says it is. It may be painful for you but not to some. It is very subjective. However, some procedures are never more painful than having your tooth extracted while some may be simply minor discomforts. The fact of the matter is <a
href="http://dentistoflasvegasnv.com/top-10-must-haves-for-choosing-a-new-dentist/">any cosmetic dentist</a> will make sure that your treatment will proceed in a safe and comfortable manner.</p><h2>4. It is Unnecessary to Get Cosmetic Procedures for the Teeth</h2><p>Many individuals look at these procedures as something that is totally unnecessary. Unfortunately, these same procedures can also have some restorative functions. For example, porcelain veneers can help protect chipped and cracked teeth from further damage. Dental implants can also restore lost bone mass of the jaw. These are necessary to help prevent further dental problems.</p><h2>5. Cosmetic Dental Procedures Damage Natural Teeth</h2><p>Cosmetic dentists specialize in the care of the teeth and how to make the teeth look and function a lot better. They do carefully so by studying the structure of one’s teeth and if the procedures are not wise, then they will tell you outright. Generally <a
href="http://dentistoflasvegasnv.com/clark-county/cosmetic-dentistry/" target="_blank">cosmetic dentistry</a><strong> </strong>prides itself in saving the structure of teeth and be able to help in extending the lifespan of the teeth.</p><p>These are five of the most common myths about cosmetic dentistry procedures. It should be understood that with continuing advances in dental technology, more and more of these myths are being busted.</p><p>The post <a

Much like those stars of Hollywood, the stars of the Las Vegas strip, from the pirates to the Cirque du Soleil all require the players to look their best, right down to their smiles. Other shows focus on singers and comedians, both of whom make their living with their mouths. Since all eyes are on these amazing smiles, how do they guarantee the best look to their teeth year after year?</p><p>Many of these individuals look to their <a
href="http://dentistoflasvegasnv.com/clark-county/cosmetic-dentistry/">local cosmetic dentist in Las Vegas</a>. These dentists can provide not only basic oral health care; they can also provide porcelain veneers that can address a multitude of problems within the mouth. What are some of the other options available?</p><h3><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3746" src="../../../../dentistoflasvegasnv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jersey-Boys-300x300.jpg" alt="las vegas shows " width="300" height="300" />Dental Veneers</h3><p>Cosmetic dentistry can address uneven teeth with veneers, but for missing teeth or large gaps, individuals have the option of using dental implants. These fronts are measured and formed to fit discreetly into your mouth and look as natural as your other teeth. Yet, if you don’t have a missing tooth, you can take advantage of caps or crowns to address unevenness or discoloration issues <a
href="http://dentistoflasvegasnv.com/5-common-misconceptions-about-cosmetic-dentistry/">instead of veneers</a>.</p><h3>Inlays &amp; Onlays</h3><p>Another option to deal with decay or damaged teeth is inlays and onlays. These provide an excellent fit over damaged teeth, safeguarding them while allowing functionality and easy cleaning. An inlay is bonded to the center of the tooth, while an onlay is when the material is required to cover a larger area of the tooth. While both options preserve the natural and healthy areas of the teeth, they also preserve the natural color of your teeth, versus the composite resin dental filling. Therefore, you can create a stronger and more natural looking tooth as a repair to tooth decay. However, like crowns, inlays and onlays are a multi-step process to complete with the best results. This option also provides a custom fit and is often known as a stronger solution to normal fillings.</p><h3><img

href="http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/dental-bonding" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">composite bonding</a> to address chipped or misaligned teeth. This method uses resin material to cover up any imperfections or that can fill in spaces. Those who use composite bonding can also cover signs of erosion or even the roots that may have begun to show as a result of gingival recession. The resin is applied to the tooth and then shaped and molded to fit into various tight spots, including chips in the enamel. Additionally, the resin can be color matched to your teeth, so that it will blend right in with your other teeth.</p><p>Las Vegas cosmetic dentists can provide all these options and more to address a variety of concerns for these stars of the stage, but also for those who are just wishing to make changes to <a

As you can see, Las Vegas not only provides amazing entertainment options, but it also provides the stars of these shows the ability to brighten their smiles with multiple cosmetic dentistry choices.</p><p>The post <a

href="http://dentistoflasvegasnv.com/clark-county/cosmetic-dentistry/">cosmetic dentistry</a> and general dentistry. Not only do most patients confuse the two areas, but also there are numerous misconceptions surrounding this beautification process. If you are interested in getting the facts straight, here is an overview of the differences and five of the most common misconceptions surrounding the world&#8217;s favorite dental procedures. Unlike general dentistry that addresses oral health issues such as tooth and gum health, cosmetic dentistry focuses on the improving the overall appearance of your teeth.</p><h3>Cosmetic Dentistry is Only for the Rich</h3><p>The most common misconception surrounding cosmetic dentistry is that you must be significantly affluent to afford cosmetic dentistry procedures such as <a
href="http://dentistoflasvegasnv.com/5-reasons-consider-zoom-teeth-whitening/">teeth whitening</a>. To the contrary, anyone can afford cosmetic dentistry. The only difference between affluent folks and less affluent is how many procedures may be afforded at once or how long payment schedules run. At the end of the day, cosmetic dentistry is affordable and usually, your dentist will work with you to figure out a comfortable payment plan that you can handle. You should also feel open to discussing your financial abilities in relation to a particular cosmetic procedure.</p><h3>All Your Teeth Need to be Treated</h3><p>The second misconception is that when receiving cosmetic dentistry, the dentist will need to treat each one of your teeth to perfect your smile. The truth is, your dentist will first determine which teeth require cosmetic treatment, the type of cosmetic treatment needed, and the overall effect of the procedures upon generating a perfect smile. In all likelihood, only some teeth will require treatment to achieve a successful result.</p><h3>Cosmetic Dentistry is a Lengthy Process</h3><p>The third misconception is that cosmetic dentistry is like general dentistry; you need several procedures to achieve a good result. Actually, most cosmetic dentistry procedures require just one office visit and a subsequently follow up after several months. For example, if you are getting a teeth whitening done, then the procedure is usually one office visit and if your teeth darken in color, you may need a follow up appointment after a few months.</p><h3>Procedures Can Be Painful</h3><p>The fourth misconception is that cosmetic procedures are often painful. Truth is told, if you are experiencing pain or have experienced pain from dentistry, then your dentist must have done something wrong. Cosmetic dentistry is largely painless and to mitigate sensitivity, your dental professional should have provided you with an anesthetic or numbing agent.</p><h3><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3255" src="../../../../dentistoflasvegasnv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/june_metal-300x300.jpg" alt="Beautiful young woman smiling. Isolated over white background" width="300" height="300" />Cosmetic Dentistry Is Harmful to Teeth</h3><p>Finally, there are many patients who harbor the belief that cosmetic dentistry is harmful to teeth. Unlike what many think, cosmetic dentistry just treats the appearance of the tooth, not its structure. As a result, cosmetic dentistry does not harm your teeth in any way.</p><p>Now, that you know the facts regarding cosmetic dentistry, you can make the right decision for you and your teeth. Ultimately, most are happier after performing cosmetic dentistry than they were beforehand.</p><p>The post <a

They are porcelain shells of the same color as your teeth, which are fitted to improve your appearance/smile. Despite <a
href="http://www.deardoctor.com/articles/smile-design-enhanced-with-porcelain-veneers/page2.php" target="_blank">this popularity</a>, there are many who do not have an idea of what porcelain veneers are for or how they function.</p><p>We get several queries here at Streamline Decatur Office in Las Vegas from different parts of the globe asking about our service. Read on to find out the answers to some frequently asked questions about porcelain veneers and their functionality.</p><p>Question #1: What are dental/porcelain veneers?<br
/> Porcelain veneers are thin pieces of porcelain bonded to the teeth so that they resemble natural teeth. Made from specialized ceramic material meant for the purpose, these shells are fitted onto the teeth to cover other imperfections so that the appearance or smile is improved.</p><p>Question #2: When are porcelain veneers used?<br
/> Porcelain dental veneers are versatile and can be used to fix a <a
href="http://dentistoflasvegasnv.com/porcelain-cosmetic-dental-crowns-restore-and-rejuvenate-your-smile/">variety of dental problems</a>. When porcelain veneers are used, they can dramatically change the facial appearance/smile of the individual. However, the decision to fix porcelain veneer is taken by the concerned specialist only after a thorough evaluation of the specific case. Porcelain veneers are used to cover broken/chipped tooth, hide discoloration of the teeth in the front, and to also fix crooked teeth that are not in alignment with the rest.</p><p>Question #3: Can dental veneers help to cover chipped/cracked teeth?<br
/> It is a known fact that chipped or cracked teeth lessen the effect of a nice smile. Porcelain veneer shells can be fitted over the chips or cracks and hide them from view to make the smile more appealing.</p><p>Question #4: Can dental veneers be used to hide stains / discoloration on the teeth? There are different types of treatments to overcome discoloration of teeth. Many of them are effective in that they help to <a
href="http://dentistoflasvegasnv.com/whiter-teeth-change-lives/">improve the color of the teeth</a> greatly. However, this entails many visits to the dentist’s office. It is also possible that some deep stains cannot just be removed. In such cases, the best solution is to fix porcelain veneers over the discolored teeth. Any type of stain can be covered using this method.</p><p>Question #5: Are dental veneers used for straightening crooked/misaligned teeth? To straighten crooked/misaligned teeth, a patient has to undergo orthodontic treatment that may take months and many visits to the dentist’s office. It is also likely to be expensive. This problem can be instantly addressed by using porcelain veneers or <a
href="http://dentistoflasvegasnv.com/lumineers-no-prep-dental-veneers/">lumineers</a>. Misaligned or crooked teeth can be fixed to form perfectly even rows of teeth in a matter of just two visits.</p><p>Question #6: Are there any preconditions that patients have to satisfy to have porcelain veneers fixed? The best candidates who can have porcelain veneers fixed are those who have a good overall dental health. The teeth should also be strong because a small amount of tooth material is removed to fix the porcelain veneer cap. Half a millimeter of a tooth is usually removed to fix the dental veneer.</p><p>Question #7: Can porcelain veneers be fixed for any individual? Though porcelain veneers are versatile and can be used to treat several conditions, not every patient is a good candidate for porcelain veneers. Any patient that visits our office will undergo a comprehensive study and evaluation to determine whether porcelain veneers will help to solve the problem. However, we have seen that most patients who are fitted with dental veneers are completely satisfied with the results.</p><p>Question #8: What are the advantages of using porcelain veneers? There are many advantages of using porcelain veneers. First, they can be used to overcome many problems of the teeth in a very short span of time that otherwise take many visits to the dentist. This is also why dental veneers are also called instant orthodontics. Another major advantage is that they give a completely natural look, and it is hard to distinguish porcelain veneer from natural teeth after treatment.</p><p>Question #9: Are <a
href="http://dentistoflasvegasnv.com/cosmetic-dentistry/">dental veneers</a> effective? Porcelain veneers are both effective and versatile in that a variety of dental problems can be treated with them. Treatment with porcelain veneers falls under the realm of conservative dentistry, which means that the tooth structure is not compromised or reduced during the procedure.</p><p>Question #10: Are porcelain veneers popular? Porcelain veneers are growing popular by the day because they help to retain the natural look of the teeth. This is the reason celebrities are choosing to have some of their dental problems fixed with the help of these veneers. They are semi-translucent and appear 100% natural in natural or artificial light. It is difficult to differentiate between the veneer cap and the natural tooth for the onlooker.</p><p>Question #11: How should one take care of porcelain veneers? Caring for your porcelain veneers is simple and easy. They need the same care as your natural teeth. Ensure that you brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss your teeth just before you go to sleep to maintain dental hygiene. However, it is important that you visit your dentist at least two times in a year for a checkup. Their position may need adjustments over time for the best alignment results.</p><p>Question #12: What is procedure for fixing porcelain veneers? Fixing dental veneer essentially involves three steps. In the first step, the impression of the tooth with the problem is taken after adequate preparation at the dentist’s office. This impression is then dispatched to a laboratory where a permanent veneer is constructed according to the impression received. The second step involves the placement of a temporary veneer until the time the permanent dental veneer is ready. The third and final step is the fixing of the actual porcelain veneer on to the tooth once it is received from the laboratory.</p><p>Question #13: Is it expensive to have your teeth fitted with porcelain veneers? The cost of porcelain veneers will depend on factors such as the dentist that you are visiting, the geographic location, and the <a
href="http://dentistoflasvegasnv.com/3-reasons-why-you-need-a-root-canal/">dental problem</a> that needs to be fixed using veneers. On average, porcelain veneers are likely to cost anything between $1000 and $2000 per tooth cap.</p><p>Question #14: Where can I get more information about porcelain veneers? Though we have managed to answer many of your basic questions, we are sure that you will have many more questions in your mind regarding porcelain veneers. You can get more information on our website, or you can also call us to set up an appointment.</p><p>The post <a
